1. Implement Nametable
2. Fix Rendering Bug
3. Implement Fulltick and Fullframe
4. Try to render only once per frame
5. Implement Debug
6. Implement Debug in the original 
7. Performane comparison
8. If performance is still slow then:

        1. Bus will not use an IORef to the CPU. It will just hold the CPU as value
        2. R2C02 Tick will return True, where True is whether or not we should send an NMI request to the CPU
        3. Bus will tick R2C02, check the result and only then trigger the CPU.
