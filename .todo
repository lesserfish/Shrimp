Bug 1:
    Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) show be used in arithmetic operations when the decimal bit is set.
    Currently, the biggest problem lies in decodeBSD.
    For example, the BCD Sum of 0xD7 + 0x9B + 0x01 is 
        (encodeBCD 0xD7) + (encodeBCD 0x9B) + (encodeBCD 0x01) = 39
    The correct value for accumulator is 0xD9 = 217. The current implementation of decodeBSD gives 217.
    But
    encodeBSD 0xD9 = encodeBSD 217 = 39
    Why would the CPU give 0xD9?
